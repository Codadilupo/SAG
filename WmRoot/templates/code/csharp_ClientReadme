                       Generated C# Client
_____________________________________________________________________

   The C# client produced by Software AG Designer demonstrates the most 
   common uses of the webMethods C# client API and should serve as a good 
   starting point for your own development.

   To compile and run the generated C# client, you need access to the following 
   library, which constitutes the C# client API:
   
   wmClientAPI.dll
   
   Edit the generated Makefile ([svcName].mak) to reflect the
   locations of the C# client API files and generated C# client
   source file. Also, make sure to set the PATH to your Microsoft .NET Framework
   installation. This sets the reference directories necessary to compile your
   client. 
   
   You will require the Windows nmake utility (available at
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe).
   
   Compile the generated client:  
   
	    > nmake -f [svcName].mak
   
   You can execute the [svcName].exe from a Command 
   Prompt.  The client will connect to the Integration Server 
   used when generating the client. 

   If you require a different Integration Server, please modify as 
   indicated in the source. You must supply a username and 
   password at the command line: [svcName].exe <username> <password>. 
   
   You will be prompted to supply values for all input variables of type 
   string, string list and string table at the command line.

   The client will prompt for inputs at the command-line.  The results 
   of the service are displayed on standard output.
